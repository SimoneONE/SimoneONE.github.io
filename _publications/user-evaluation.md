excerpt: 'This paper provides a systematic comparative evaluation of existing implementations of automated process discovery methods with domain experts by using a real-life event log extracted from an international software engineering company and four quality metrics: understandability, correctness, precision, and usefulness. The evaluation results highlight gaps and unexplored trade-offs in the field and allow researchers to improve the lacks in the automated process discovery methods in terms of usability of process discovery techniques in industry.'

This paper provides a systematic comparative evaluation of existing implementations of automated process discovery methods with domain experts by using a real-life event log extracted from an international software engineering company and four quality metrics: understandability, correctness, precision, and usefulness. The evaluation results highlight gaps and unexplored trade-offs in the field and allow researchers to improve the lacks in the automated process discovery methods in terms of usability of process discovery techniques in industry.
