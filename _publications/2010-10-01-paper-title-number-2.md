title: "Synthesis of Strategies for Robotic Process Automation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This PhD paper presents my research proposal: Robotic Process Automation is an umbrella term for tools that run on an end user’s computer, emulating tasks previously executed through a user interface by means of a software robot. Nowadays, only simple, predictable tasks can be automated in situations where there is no room for interpretation, while more sophisticated work is still left to human experts. The here proposed research aims at tackling this issue through a paradigm shift in conceiving software robots that are able to  behave  intelligently  and  flexibly  in  many  dynamic  and  knowledge-intensive situations that are common in today’s application scenarios.'
