title: "Verifying Petri Net-Based Process Models using Automated Planning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/petrinets
excerpt: 'In this paper, starting from a Petri net-based representation of a BP model, we show how instances of the verification problem can be represented as planning problems in PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) for which planners can find a correct solution in a finite amount of time. If verification problems are converted into planning problems, one can seamlessly leverage the best performing automated planners, with evident advantages in terms of versatility and customization.'

In this paper, starting from a Petri net-based representation of a BP model, we show how instances of the verification problem can be represented as planning problems in PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) for which planners can find a correct solution in a finite amount of time. If verification problems are converted into planning problems, one can seamlessly leverage the best performing automated planners, with evident advantages in terms of versatility and customization.
