This paper provides an analysis of the main privacy constraints in GDPR and propose a set of design patterns to capturing and integrating such constraints in BP models. Using BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) as modeling notation, our approach allows us to achieve full transparency of privacy constraints in BPs making it possible to ensure their compliance with GDPR.
